			<p>Gurren Lagann is a Japanese anime television series produced by Gainax and directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi. It tells the story of Simon and Kamina, who live in a subterranean village where they toil in oppressive drudgery, until Simon discovers a mysterious drill that leads him to the surface, where he and Kamina join forces with other humans in a fight against the Beastmen who control the surface world. The series features elements of mecha, action, and comedy, and has become known for its over-the-top style and epic battles.</p>
            <p>In a far away future, mankind lives underground in huge caves, unknowing of a world above with a sky and stars.</p>
            <p>In the small village of Jiha, Simon, a shy boy who works as a digger discovers a strange glowing object during excavation. The enterprising Kamina, a young man with a pair of rakish sunglasses and the passion of a firey sun, befriends Simon and forms a small band of brothers, the Gurren Brigade, to escape the village and break through the ceiling of the cave to reach the surface, which few believe exist.</p>
            <p>The village elder won't hear of such foolishness and punishes the Brigade. However, when disaster strikes from the world above and the entire village is in jeopardy, it's up to Simon, Kamina, a girl with a big gun named Yoko, and the small yet sturdy robot, Lagann, to save the day.</p>
            <p>The new friends journey to the world above and find that the surface is a harsh battlefield, and it's up to them to fight back against the rampaging Beastmen to turn the tide in the humans' favor! Pierce the heavens, Gurren Lagann!</p>

			</figure>
			<p>Yoko is a girl from Jeeha's neighboring village Littner, who had been chasing the Gunmen which entered Jeeha village. She wields an extensive range of firearms which include a long range sniper rifle (which she uses most frequently) modeled after the Barrett M82 and hand guns (which can be assumed is used for midrange or close combat) and has previous experience fighting Gunmen. Although she is of the same age group as Simon, she is mature and one of the most rational of the group.</p>
			<p>Despite always badmouthing Kamina for his reckless behavior, it did not take long for her to confess her feelings to him, which he returns. She was also Simon's love interest, until Simon discovered that she was in love with Kamina. He seems to have given up on her since meeting Nia. In episode 13 she proceeds to tell Simon that she was in love with Kamina in which Simon replied that he already knew. After the war, Yoko decided to not take part in the administration of Kamina City and decided to become a school teacher for the first new children born on the surface, but not before asking Simon to take care of Nia.</p>
